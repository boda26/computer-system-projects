Some of the similarities I found from the five APIs are: First, all the five APIs uses standard HTTP response codes, which is most commonly used today. Second, all the five APIs are restful, so that each request is independent and there is no dependency on previous result. Also, the APIs are on-demand, the users can make requests from clients to the server, and server will response back to the client with the information that the user requests. The main function of all the five APIs is to provide data for clients to receive and use. For instance, the National Weather Service API provides weather forecast and emergency notice, and the users can make requests with their geographical location and receive the weather or emergency notice at their location. All the five APIs returns JSON object, including pairs of keys and values. The users can easily use the keys to find the corresponding values, which is easy to use and also clean-formatted. Another point I noticed is that only the National Weather Service API opens to the public and is free to use, since it is a public service. Stripe, Github, CUMTD and Queue@Illinois API requires authentication, either using accounts or tokens. Those APIs performs more functions, and is limited if not authenticated. The other two APIs I found are Youtube API and Instagram API. Youtube API allows users to get the information about Youtube videos and display them on the website. Youtube API is also restful and needs authentication using Google account, and also returns a JSON object containing all the information included from the request. It supports most of the modern languages and covers both PC, ios and Android platform. Instagram API is also restful and returns JSON object. Users can make requests to get the general information, photos posted and videos of public accounts on Instagram. This API requires tokens when accessing accounts to protect the security of users. This API can also be used to invite Instagram users to test applications as introduced on the API main page.

Three best-practices I found is: first, the API should be restful, so that all the requests are independent and the users can interact with the API via single requests. Second, the API should ensure security, it should require authentication when accessing private data, information or accounts. Third, it should works on all platforms including PC and mobile, and it should also support multiple modern languages.
